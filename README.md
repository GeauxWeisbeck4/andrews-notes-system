# Andrew's Amazing Note Taking System

Welcome to my Amazing Note Taking System! I am just beginning this project but here are some of my goals and other things.

## Goals

- Note taking system that makes note taking efficient while coding in VS Code (and eventually other IDEs).
- Build a integration to share with others.
- Use a server to connect notes to the internet as a digital garden.

## To Do

- [ ] Set up note files, productivity stuff, etc.
- [ ] Set up Deno in the repository
- [ ] Get a basic way to render the notes online and deploy a site on Deno Deploy
- [ ] Design app and choose tech stack

## Tech Stack

- [Deno](https://deno.com)
